# Fast-Resizer
A reasonably fast job-threaded jpeg resizer script for PowerShell

(REQUIRES AT LEAST POWERSHELL VERSION 4.0)

Please note that this script is cobbled together with help from various sources around the internet. 
It's sort of one of those hacky Stack Overflow copy-pasta type scripts. But it works well enough. 
I would like particularly to give credit to the following sources:

Custom (Windows Vista+) style Folder Browser came from:

Original image resizing code came from Benoit Patra:
